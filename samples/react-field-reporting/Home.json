    "Text": "< p style = \"margin-left:0px;\">There are many external challenges facing the asset management industry, including demands for sustainable finance, volatility in capital markets, technological innovation, and cyber threats. Firms must also navigate further rafts of new rules, increasing regulatory divergence and greater supervisory scrutiny. Firms need to adopt resilient and dynamic business models if they are to be successful.<br>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Regulators around the world are focusing on common themes in a fast-changing world. However, a lack of global standards and national nuances mean that they are implementing detailed rules and guidance in different ways. Increasing regulatory divergence is causing complexity and challenges for cross-border asset managers in terms of how they manage and market their products.<br><br><strong>Key actions for CEOs:</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Deliver sustainable finance:</strong> Review the firm's overall strategy, embed sustainability factors into the investment process, ensure names and disclosures correctly reflect product offerings, and prepare to meet expanding disclosure requirements.</p></li><li><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Mitigate systemic risk:</strong> Review investment risk management arrangements, particularly relating to the liquidity management of open-ended funds, and stress testing.

According to the FSB<sup>1</sup>, recent growth in non-banks' share of global financial assets has been driven by investment funds. Therefore, policymakers continue to focus on the asset management industry and potential financial stability risks. The FSB and IOSCO<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;share a priority to enhance the resilience of non-banks, along with concerns about general market volatility and cyber threats (see <a href=\"https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2023/08/resilient-business-models.html\">Chapter 4</a>).&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Liquidity management in open-ended funds (OEFs) is under the spotlight. Money market fund (MMF) reforms are more advanced but slowing, with regulators now taking stock of progress. A few regulators have remaining concerns about exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and a recent area of focus in Europe has been liability-driven investment strategies. Use of leverage, investments in private and real assets, and asset valuation also feature on regulatory agendas.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Resilient business models</h2><p aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The way in which asset managers manage risks is a constant theme for regulators, not least within the context of financial stability. Regulators are acutely aware of the threat of any type of disruption to firms and their customers, particularly in times of stress.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Greater reliance on third-party suppliers raises concerns around remaining substance in asset management firms and their oversight of the suppliers (see <a href=\"https://kpmg.com/xx/en/home/insights/2023/08/defining-good-governance.html\">Chapter 7</a>), but also about the resilience of those third parties. Cyber threats are highlighted as a key risk and technology-led business transformation and recognition of the global interconnectedness of the financial system have led to increased focus on the resilience of end-to-end business operations. And the adequacy of asset managers' financial resources and broader risk and control frameworks is also under review.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;</p><h2><br>Digital innovation: benefits and risks</h2><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Regulators are seeking to understand the impacts of technology for the industry. They want to facilitate innovation, but are also focused on identifying and mitigating risks.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Both Fin Tech and Big Tech receive multiple references in recent regulatory outputs, along with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Distributed ledger technology (DLT) underpins crypto-assets but is also being put to good use in market infrastructure initiatives, including fund unit tokenization and settlement. Regulators are cognizant of the greater use by investors of social media and online platforms, but recognize the risks as well as the potential benefits.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&nbsp;</p>"
