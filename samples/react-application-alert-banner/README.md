## Goal of this Project

Alert banners are frequently requested by organizations such as IT departments but are not readily available out-of-the-box. This extension aims to provide a flexible and reusable alert system that any organization can deploy with ease.

Additionally, this project serves as an opportunity to refresh and enhance coding skills within the SPFx ecosystem.

## Features

This SPFx extension offers the following capabilities:

- **Fetch Alerts**: Retrieves alerts from a designated SharePoint list using the Microsoft Graph API.
- **Display Alerts**: Show alerts prominently in the banner of Modern SharePoint pages.
- **Dynamic Alert Type Configuration**: Configure alert types dynamically using a JSON property, allowing easy customization and scalability.
- **User Interaction Handling**: Allows users to dismiss alerts, with the option to prevent dismissed alerts from reappearing.
- **Performance Optimization**: Utilizes local storage for caching alerts, improving performance.

## TODO

- ~~**Multi-Site Support**: Extend support for Root, Local, and Hub sites. ~~(Done)
- **Enhanced Design**: Improve design aesthetics and CSS customization options.
- **Advanced Sorting**: Implement sorting of alerts based on priority and date.

## Managing Alerts

- **Global Alerts**: Deployed across all sites, fetching alerts from the root site where the extension is installed.
- **Local Alerts**: After the extension is added to a site collection, a new list titled "Alerts" is automatically created in the Site Contents. To create a new alert, simply add a new item to this list.

### Alert List Configuration:

- **Title**: The main heading of the alert.
- **Description**: Detailed message content.
- **AlertType**: The type of alert, such as Info, Warning, Maintenance, or Interruption.
- **Link**: Optional URL for additional information or related content.

### Dynamic Alert Type Configuration:

Alert types can now be customized dynamically using a JSON configuration property. This allows administrators to add, modify, or remove alert types without altering the codebase. The JSON structure defines the appearance and behavior of each alert type, including icons, colors, and additional styles.

**Example JSON Structure:**

```json
[
    {
       "name":"Info",
       "iconName":"Info12",
       "backgroundColor":"#389899",
       "textColor":"#ffffff",
       "additionalStyles":""
    },
    {
       "name":"Warning",
       "iconName":"ShieldAlert",
       "backgroundColor":"#f1c40f",
       "textColor":"#ffffff",
       "additionalStyles":""
    },
    {
       "name":"Maintenance",
       "iconName":"CRMServices",
       "backgroundColor":"#afd6d6",
       "textColor":"#ffffff",
       "additionalStyles":""
    },
    {
       "name":"Interruption",
       "iconName":"IncidentTriangle",
       "backgroundColor":"#c54644",
       "textColor":"#ffffff",
       "additionalStyles":""
    }
 ]
```
